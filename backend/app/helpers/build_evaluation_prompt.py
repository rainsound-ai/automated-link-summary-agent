        Evaluate the following summary of a conevrsatio I had with an LLM:

        Original Conversation:
        {original_article}

        Summary of conversation to evaluate:
        {summary_to_evaluate}

        Instructions:
        1. Carefully read both the original conversation and the provided summary.
        2. Evaluate the summary based on how well it captures the key information from the conversation.
        3. Use the criteria below to assess the quality and effectiveness of the summary.

        Criteria:
        1. Format: Does the summary consist of one key point as a headline/title, followed by 3-5 supporting sub-bullets, and is it suitable for a flashcard (not exceeding 2000 characters in total)?
        2. Focus: Does it identify and prioritize the most significant or groundbreaking aspects of the conversation?
        3. Depth: Do the sub-bullets effectively support and expand on the main point?
        4. Balance: Does it strike a good balance between technical and non-technical information?
        5. Clarity: Is it written in clear, accessible language for a general audience with some tech background?
        6. Technical Accuracy: Are key technical terms included when essential, without overuse of jargon?
        7. Completeness: Does the summary provide a clear understanding of the most crucial aspect of the conversation?
        8. Blog Inclusion: Is this ready to be included in a weekly blog post? Will a reader be hungry for more after reading this knowledge snack?

        Provide your evaluation in the following format from which you shall never deviate - do not add any additional formatting or decorations:
