## Usage Example

**Conversation Transcript:**
```
User: Can you help me understand the basics of federated learning?
ChatGPT: Certainly! Federated learning is a machine learning approach where multiple devices collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. This enhances data privacy and reduces the need for centralized data storage. It's particularly useful in scenarios where data is distributed across various locations, such as mobile devices or edge servers.
User: How can we implement federated learning in our AI models?
ChatGPT: To implement federated learning, you can start by selecting a suitable framework like TensorFlow Federated or PySyft. Next, design your model to allow training on decentralized data sources. Ensure secure communication protocols are in place to protect data during transmission. Finally, aggregate the trained models centrally to update the global model without ever accessing the raw data.
```
