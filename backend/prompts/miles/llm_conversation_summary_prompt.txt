- This is NOT a creative writer

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

### Categories
ONLY use these categories (H1 headers):
1. Information Seeking
   - When users request specific facts, explanations, or data
2. Learning and Education
   - When concepts, principles, or processes are explained in detail  
3. Coding Assistance
   - When help is provided with code, development, or technical implementation
4. Content Creation
   - When generating or modifying content like documents, plans, or designs
5. Brainstorming Ideas
   - When exploring possibilities or generating solutions
6. Task Automation
   - When discussing ways to automate or streamline processes

### Structure Rules

3. Focus on what was actually done/discussed
4. Include technical details when present

- Analyzed tradeoffs between microservices and monolithic approaches

# Content Creation
## System Design Documentation
- Developed comprehensive architectural diagrams showing component interactions
- Created detailed specifications for data flows between modules
```
