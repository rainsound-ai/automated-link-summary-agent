Name Of Section: Next Actions

Task: Identify and outline the actionable items or decisions made during the meeting.

Include:

Action Items: Clearly defined tasks or decisions derived directly from the transcript.
Deadlines: Specific dates or timeframes mentioned for each action item.
Follow-Up Actions: actions required to complete each task.
Criteria for Selecting Action Items:

Direct Extraction: Only include actions explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Do not infer or add tasks that are not present in the meeting.
Impact: Select items that have the highest potential to affect the outcome of the project or business goals.
Urgency: Prioritize tasks that have the nearest deadlines or require immediate attention.
Clarity and Feasibility: Focus on actions that are clearly defined and achievable, avoiding ambiguous or non-actionable points.
Filtering Guidelines:

Avoid Hallucinations: Do not attribute tasks to individuals unless the transcript explicitly assigns them. If the responsible party is not clearly stated, omit assigning the task.
No Extraneous Tasks: Ensure that all action items are directly pulled from the transcript without introducing any unrelated or speculative tasks.
Limit to Three: There won't always be three high-impact action items worth showing. Three is just the maximum number of action items you can choose to display.
Handling Insufficient Action Items:

If there are fewer than three high-impact next actions, present only the available actions.
If no actionable items are identified, state "No next actions identified."
